This project showcases the implementation of an End-to-End ETL Data Pipeline, delivering advanced exploratory analysis of the Makeup and Cosmetics market. My goal was to transform disparate raw data into actionable insights for strategic business decision-making within the highly competitive beauty sector.

Data Sources:

Web Scraping (Amazon): Extracted specific Real-time Product Data for makeup items, including dynamic pricing, customer ratings, brand information, and seller details.

Supplementary Dataset (Kaggle): Used to enrich the core data with specialized Metadata, such as product ingredients, color shades, and detailed product attributes.

The process involved rigorous Data Pre-processing to perform type corrections, handle Missing Values, and ensure Data Quality before loading the cleaned data into a Relational Database ready for reporting.

üèóÔ∏è What I Developed (Technical Stack):

Designed and deployed an effective Custom Web Scraper tailored for e-commerce data extraction.

Developed robust Python Scripts (using Pandas, NumPy) for complex data Transformation and enrichment logic.

Created a structured Relational Database Schema to store and manage the processed tables efficiently.

Utilized Advanced Python and SQL Queries to derive Actionable Insights.

Built a Dynamic Visualization Layer (Dashboard) to clearly present Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and findings.

üí° Key Findings & Insights:

Market Performance & Trends: Identified Bestselling products and dominant brands within key makeup categories. Classified products based on Top Ratings versus sheer volume.

Customer Sentiment Analysis: Performed Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews to pinpoint product strengths (e.g., coverage, blendability) and weaknesses (e.g., longevity, packaging), revealing unmet market needs.

Pricing & Value Perception: Conducted an analysis comparing Pricing against customer ratings across different product tiers (luxury vs. budget) to determine the perceived value of various brands.
